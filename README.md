# MyGenes
****
**Overview:** MyGenes is an environment dependant evolution of digital organisms simulator. This script and GUI were developed for my [MSc dissertation](http://danvj.com/modularity.pdf) and shared to assist in new investigations on this topic.

###Quick start

To use My Genes on your operating system you'll need to have **Python 3** installed. Make sure **NumPy** and **SciPy**. If you have no idea how to install these, I suggest downloading the Python 3 distribution by [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

After the installation, make sure Python is installed correctly on your system by opening the Terminal (or cmd.exe on Windows), type "python" or "python3" and then hit Enter. If it shows something like the image below, it means you're ready to use My Genes.

Besides Python and the modules, you'll need to download the repository. 

#####Using the GUI

Uncompress the mygenes.zip file you downloaded and double click on **mygenes.py** under the current stable version folder.
